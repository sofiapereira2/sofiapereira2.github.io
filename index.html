            Hey there! I'm Sofia — I started out in Civil Engineering but soon found myself drawn to programming, which led me to shift my career into software development. Since then, I’ve been focused on building reliable backend systems and currently work at Eve Air Mobility, where I help develop a platform for managing urban air traffic. Lately, I’ve been expanding my skills on the frontend with React and exploring Rust to deepen my understanding of system-level development. Outside of work, I love traveling, practicing yoga, watching tennis, solving Rubik’s Cubes, and listening to music — all things that keep me curious, balanced, and motivated to keep learning.
